# GrapherJS
Function grapher made in Javascript.

There are a few things to note right now:
 -You need to enter functions exactly as javascript would understand them, so for example:
   x^2 needs to be x**2
   
 -In addition, certain functions or expressions entered incorrectly could make it crash.
 -There is no entry validation yet.
